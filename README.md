# DrawingApproximater
### Uses the concept of fourier series to approximate your drawing.
First, run drawingpad1.py to save your drawing.\
Second, run fourierimagewriter.py to convert the drawing into fourier series.\
Third, run imageshower3.py to display the approximation of your drawing.

## Drawing Pad
First click anywhere on the screen to select your drawing's starting position.\
Drag the turtle to draw on the screen.\
When you are done, close the turtle window.

## Fourier Image Writer
The minimum input should be 2.\
Input of 2 would give an ellipse.\
Selecting higher values like 50 or above would be make the approximation lose its sharpness and would take more time to load.

## Image Shower
The image would be reconstructed by the turtle.\
The speed of the turtle would be determined by the level of approximation that you selected with 2 being the fastest.
